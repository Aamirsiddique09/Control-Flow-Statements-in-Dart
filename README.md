# Control_Flow_Statements_in_Dart
 Control flow statements in programming control code execution with conditionals (if, else) for decision-making, loops (for, while) for repetition, and branching statements (break, continue) for altering flow. They provide control and flexibility in directing the program's execution path.
Conditional Statements (if, else if, else)
This readme file provides an overview of conditional statements in the Dart programming language. Conditional statements, including if, else if, and else, allow you to control the flow of your program based on specific conditions. They are essential for decision-making and executing different code blocks based on various scenarios.

Usage and examples demonstrate how to utilize conditional statements to handle different conditions and execute corresponding code blocks. Compatibility notes that conditional statements are compatible with the Dart programming language across various environments and frameworks.
