# Control_Flow_Statements_in_Dart
 Control flow statements in programming control code execution with conditionals (if, else) for decision-making, loops (for, while) for repetition, and branching statements (break, continue) for altering flow. They provide control and flexibility in directing the program's execution path.
Welcome to the Control Flow Statements readme file. This document provides an overview of control flow statements in programming, focusing on their usage in the Dart programming language. Control flow statements allow you to control the execution flow of your program, making it more dynamic and adaptable.

If-Else Statements
If-else statements are used to conditionally execute code blocks based on a specified condition. The basic syntax of an if-else statement in Dart is as follows:

if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
You can also use multiple else if statements to handle multiple conditions.

Switch Statements
Switch statements provide a concise way to handle multiple cases based on the value of a variable or an expression. The basic syntax of a switch statement in Dart is as follows:

switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value2
    break;
  default:
    // Code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}
Switch statements can simplify code readability and maintainability when dealing with multiple branching conditions.

Loops: For, While, and Do-While
Loops allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. Dart provides three types of loops: for, while, and do-while.

The for loop is used when you know the exact number of iterations. It consists of an initialization, a condition, and an iteration statement.
The while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.
Break and Continue Statements
The break statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely. It terminates the current loop iteration or exits the switch statement entirely.

The continue statement is used to skip the remaining code within a loop iteration and move to the next iteration.

Usage and Examples
Control flow statements are essential for creating dynamic programs that respond to different conditions and iterate through data. They allow you to control the execution path based on specific criteria and make your code more efficient and flexible.

Examples demonstrating the usage of control flow statements in Dart can be found in the code snippets provided in the Dart documentation or tutorials..
